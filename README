Vampire Pack Manager or simply Vampire Packs is a simulator in which you control a pack of vampires taking over a city.

NOTICE: vpm is not currently a playable game, and won't be for a long time. Right now is only a bunch of classes and tests than I'm using to build the game. If anyone download it, he won't have anything to play with, save source.

I'm aiming to get an alpha that will have an extremely simple an maybe boring gameplay. But I have limited time, so the progress is quite slow.
